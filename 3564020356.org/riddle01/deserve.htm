As you may have noticed yet, nothing is really free nowadays: and so will be for my site too.<br>
<!-- Hello, readers ;) -->
Don't misunderstand me: I won't (ever!) ask you for money. Nor I will spam you. Nor I will
<!-- As you may have understood, this is the first riddle: I thought that giving it in clear -->
show you banners (that is why, I think, virtualave guys didn't like my page much ;). You will
<!-- would have been too easy, so first read the lesson01.zip tutorial from the address -->
be able to access all the information I used to give you, but you will have to deserve it.<br>
<!-- http://www.und.nodak.edu/org/crypto/crypto/lanaki.crypt.class/lessons/ -->
<br>
<!-- These are VERY interesting crypto lessons, IMO, and will help you crack this easy -->
How does it work? You will just have to solve some riddles, or publish tutes about some
<!-- simple substitution cypher: -->
projects I will propose (or about things you like... but I cannot assure you _I_ will like them
<!-- MAL TIRRUEZF CR MAL RKZYIOL EX MAL OIY UAE RICF "MAL ACWALRM -->
too so be careful ;).<br>
<!-- DYEUPLFWL CR ME DYEU MAIM UL IZL RKZZEKYFLF GH OHRMLZH" -->
<br>
<!-- Why did I wrote it all uppercase? Easy: just use a case sensitive text editor and -->
The first riddles will be easy: I don't want to keep out (almost) anyone from my site. The next
<!-- use replace to convert every uppercase cyphered letter in a lowercase plain one. It's -->
ones will be harder, and will give you access to information I hope you will consider more interesting.
<!-- easier than paper :) -->
The last ones (if there ever be last ones) will be VERY hard... and the information will be MORE
<!-- Once you have found the right password, insert it after your login in THIS -->
interesting, of course: information which cannot be easily found by search engines, due to the
<!-- page: if the login you've chosen is not used by anyone else and the password is -->
particular shape of this site; information that you can spread in other ways, if
<!-- right, you'll jump to level 1. Don't worry, you will then be prompted for a new -->
you like; information which are indeed FREE, but only for the ones who deserve it.<br>
<!-- pass to avoid others using your account. -->
<br>
<!-- NOTE: if the URL doesn't work, try /lanaki dir on this website instead -->
Here is my new site: a game I hope you and I will enjoy, a source of information which can
become useful for reversers, and a way to meet new people and work with them. Because, of
course, you can work with others to solve the riddles: the solutions will work for your
different logins and give you all access to the next level. Also, I don't mind _how_ you
solve the riddles: if you are able to find the password in any more creative way (stalking,
searching, cracking, and so on) you're allowed to do it. Just two requests: first, don't
damage the server where my pages are hosted; second, teach us the technique you have
used or the tools you've created to find the password.
<br>
<br>
I think that's all, for now. Read between the lines and find the password that, together
<!-- HINT: the cyphertext is written in English. -->
with the login name you choose, will allow you to start the game.
